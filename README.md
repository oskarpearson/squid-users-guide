# Squid User's Guide

This is the github repository for the [Squid User's Guide](http://www.deckle.co.za/squid-users-guide/) website, which used to run as a wiki site.

# Building the source

Run build.rb - which will populate the contents of the 'website/' directory.

# Thanks

Thanks go to [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/), the creators of the site put a lot of effort into making a 'book' format work well
on the internet. The CSS I've used relies largely on the word-spacing and margins they chose.

Thanks also go to [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) - the new site is HTML5 compliant.

# Contributing

Please contribute! I'd happy accept dramatic changes that approve the site and update it to the newest Squid releases. The previous wiki format wasn't great
for editing, as users were very constrained within the current pages. This seemed to make the site difficult to restructure, as pulling content from
page A to page B was a difficult process.

Ideally I would like to transition the site into a larger number of smaller pages, with dedicated and useful content on each page, and to some
level remove the "book" concept that originally led to these pages.

# More Thanks

More thanks go to the users that have contributed and linked to the guide over the years!
